Here are the sources to generate the pdf/slideshow support
for a git training course.

This particular slideshow was designed with rather high expectations regarding:
1. Rendering quality (so it's nice, well constructed and portable).
2. Animation quality (so it's very clear *what git is doing* during the course).

To address 1., pgf/tikz was chosen,
embedded within a vanilla `standalone` LaTeX document.  
LaTeX/beamer alone were not sophisticated/comfortable enough to address 2.
As a consequence, python scripts were used instead.

These two languages are not exactly designed to work together,
so the project has become unexpectedly big.  
Obviously, the first course to be given with this slideshow
had a definite date, and I was late to meet that date,
so the project has also become unexpectedly messy.  
So we are ending up here with a big and messy project
whose only purpose is to produce one pdf/slideshow.
Hopefully it is also making it possible, in the future,
to edit the slideshow and make it evolve in a (rather) flexible way.

#### Generate the document

With python 3.11 and lualatex, just run:

```shell
$ python main.py
```

Wait for â‰ˆ5min for the compilation to happen,
then find your result in the newly created `./res.pdf` file.

#### Current slideshow content

- Introduction to git (from scratch).
- Git clients.
- Commit, push commits to a remote.
- Clone, fetch commits, collaborate.
- Solve conflicts.
- Merge or Rebase.

In particular, there is no mention made of:
- branches (I mean, branches with different names to collaborate with)
- submodules
- advanced git utilities like cherry-pick, interactive rebase, hooks, *etc.*

yet.

#### Current implementation

I am not quite happy with the current implementation
and I do have a strong desire to rewrite all of it.
Unfortunately (or fortunately maybe?) there is little chance
that this'll happen anytime soon.  

The major justification why this has become so sophisticated
is that animation of every slide can be written in the following form:

- `./pizzas.py`
- `./staging.py`
- `./remotes.py`
- `./conflicts.py`
- *etc.*

There is one such file per slide,
and the purpose of all these files
is to parse one particular section
of the current stub file found at..

- `./tex/main.tex`

.. and to introduce slight modifications in it on every animation step,
in a programmable fashion.

On every "step", a new section is generated into the resulting..

- `./tex/generated_steps.tex`

.. which is the one eventually compiled when `./main.py` is run.
Every step is a new page in the resulting file.

The other files within the `./tex` folder, like..

- `./tex/files.tex`
- `./tex/repo.tex`
- `./tex/diff.tex`
- *etc.*

.. provide all high-level LaTeX commands
used to produce file trees, chains of commits, diffed files, etc.

The other python files like..

- `./filetree.py`
- `./repo.py`
- `./diffs.py`
- *etc.*

.. are mirroring them to translate them into python manipulable objects.

The major pattern at play here is the one found in the core file:

- `./modifiers.py`

The abstract class `TextModifier`
is the one parenting most of the useful objects within the python scripts.
In a nutshell, a `TextModifier` value
is an object bound to a particular piece of LaTeX code,
with special attributes and a `.render()` method.
When `.render()` is called, the current attributes values are read
to produce one adequate version of the code,
with *e.g.* correctly updated style, positionning, textual content *etc.*
`TextModifier` objects can contain each other as attributes,
and they are rendered recursively.
The root of the modifiers tree is the a `Document` value
whose definition can be found at:

- `./document.py`


`TextModifier` objects are constructed
by another category of objects called `*Builder`s.
There are two ways of producing a new `TextModifier` value:

- Either by __parsing__ an existing piece of LaTeX code
  found in the stub `./tex/main.tex` file, with a `.parse()` method.
- Or from a python-originated set of attributes, with a `.new()` method.

There is much fragility here,
because the `parse` methods are all very naive,
lexical-based with no deep understanding of LaTeX language implemented.
As a consequence, they are much fragile
to the actual, lexical content of `*.tex` files,
and you can break the whole process
by just changing *a comment line* or even *whitespace* within the `*.tex` files.
Hopefully either python or the LaTeX compilation process
should crash in such a situation,
so you can figure that there is something wrong.  
If it's python, it's because safety `assert` guards
have been introduced here and there,
and you can navigate to the failed assertion
to make an attempt to figure which assumption/invariant has not been met.  
If it's LaTeX, the message is rarely helpful,
but you can open the `./tex/generated_steps.tex` file
and figure out what went wrong during the rendering stage.

There is also fragility in the sense that
there is no guarantee whatsoever
that the LaTeX code eventually generated by a `TextModifier` object
could even be "parsed back" by the corresponding builder into a similar value.
So there is no "rendering-parsing" loop,
and "rendering" is __not__ a kind of serialization.

Since compilation is long,
you can choose to only generate particular sections of the slideshow
by using the corresponding slides names and/or numbers
as special arguments to `doc.generate_tex()` in `main.py`.
For example, `doc.generate_tex(5, 9)` will only generate pages 5 to 9 (included)
and `doc.generated_steps("Conflicts")` will only generate pages
for the "Conflicts" slide.

This is it, happy hacking if you ever even *wish* to get in there,
and I hope that the future is bright with (better) constructive,
open-source slideshow animation software..

.. hm. I actually have a few ideas about that.. stay tuned.. maybe? I guess?
